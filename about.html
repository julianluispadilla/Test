			<p class="Description">We do everything from identifying great spaces to selling the houses themselves.
			With the current housing shortage at the top of every political agenda, we’re building homes the nation needs. 
			A career in house building can be incredibly versatile. We work with communities to find suitable locations and collaborate
			with architects and planners to design great places. Then to actually build a home, we need everything from craftsmen 
			to project managers and sales advisors.
			All of these roles come together to make each home as attractive, affordable and efficient as can be. 
			That means keeping them warmer in the winter, cooler in the summer, and helping families save money on bills all year round. 
			As the name suggests and putting it simply, house builders build houses. From identifying suitable spaces to develop,
			to building the homes, to marketing them and selling them. When it comes to working for a house builder, there’s far more to
			get excited.
			The current housing shortage is one of the most important issues the country faces, and that means that house building is at
			the top of the political agenda. Each of the main political parties agree that something needs to be done to increase the 
			supply of houses in order to catch up with demand and help reduce prices. And while the problem cannot be solved by house 
			builders alone, we will undoubtedly play a vital part in helping to solve the issue.
			And that’s where you come in. If we are to rise to the challenge and build the homes that the nation needs, then we need the 
			best and brightest of Pilipino's workforce, now and in the future. With the best of Pilipino talent on our side.
			Our strong desire to improve the way the industry operates means that we are constantly challenging tradition and adapting to
			the needs of a rapidly changing world. We are committed to offering you an comprehensive services worldwide.</p>
