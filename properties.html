				<p> 
The epitome of mid-century modern, this “atomic ranch” features many original built ins and wood paneling. The retro eat-in kitchen is a sight to see, and we love the backyard patio with built in stone grilling station. </p>

				<h1> FOR SALE AND FOR RENT </h1>
				<p> 
If you have a large family (or have plans to have one), this six-bedroom home might be for you. The completely remodeled kitchen, new hardwood floors and walls of glass that let in tons of light are just a few reasons you will fall hard for this place. </p>

				<h1> FOR SALE AND FOR RENT </h1>
				<p> This home suffers from outdated interiors, but at this price point, a first-time home buyer could easily afford to upgrade. What we love: the brick chimney, vaulted ceilings, fenced-in back patio and master bedroom with access to the backyard. </p>
